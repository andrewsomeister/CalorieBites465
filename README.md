# CS465 UIUC Course Project: CalorieBites
This project was part of CS465 at UIUC, focusing on developing interactive software with smart design choices.
The course emphasized user experience and interface design, guiding us to create applications with practical
and user-centric designs.

## CalorieBites Concept
CalorieBites is a front-end app prototype created using Android Studio designed to make calorie tracking relatable and straightforward.
It converts steps into food calorie equivalents, offering an intuitive approach to health management. While
it's currently a prototype, it showcases the potential for a comprehensive, user-friendly health app.
